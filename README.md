# electron
Visualize electron field energy flow.
PHP script calculating Umov-Poynting vectors for the electromagnetic field of the "classical electron" - a particle carrying point-like electric charge and magnetic momentum,
and building corresponding energy flow lines. Run electron.php in the browser.

Parameters:
- $e_part - relative contribution of electric charge, 
- $m_part - relative contribution of magnetic momentum,
- $v - speed of the electron,
- $N - number of iterations,
- $dt - time shift at one iteration,
- $scale - image scale.
